## あまり アイコン

あまり アイコン (*amari aikon*) is my very personal icon pack, used mostly in Android (because icons matter only on smartphones, you don't need them on the desktop or laptop). It is made of 27 glyphs on 7 different backgrounds (as in the [あまり カラーズ](/okucha/amari/colors.proj) color scheme), which gives us 189 icons, plus one for the pack.

I really thank Wikicommons users for providing the majority of glyphs (either as-is or I modified them a little). I also want to thank the creators of Hammersmith One font (which is used for the letter **a** icon) and Source Han Sans font (which is used for letter **あ** icon).

あまり (*amari*) (Japanese word that means *not much*, *not often*, *very* (with negative verbs)) is an attempt to create an integrated and consistent way of presenting information on my website, presentations, documents and user interfaces. The name is a way of describing how these attempts are most probable to turn out.
